# term-paper-on-js-html
Course project on HTML. Yeah, it's old to look at this today, but these are my very first steps in programming. The aim of the project was to show the basic knowledge of layout, styling skills and a bit of JS. 
The project remains here solely to create a general picture of my development as a developer, it is definitely not worth launching ðŸ—¿.
